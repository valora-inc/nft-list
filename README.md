# nft-list

A curated list of NFT contracts. Valora attempts to automatically
discover ERC-721 contracts, however, there are cases where a project
should consider adding to this list. See [Adding new ERC-721
contracts](./docs/adding-new-erc721-contracts.md) for more details.

## Developing

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

run tests:

```
yarn test
```

## Adding a contract

Add contract addresses to
[alfajores-nft-list.json](./src/alfajores-nft-list.json) or
[mainnet-nft-list.json](src/mainnet-nft-list.json) and create a PR for
the Valora team to review.
